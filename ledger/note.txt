So with sharding some things change when it comes to block processing...
What you would do is insert from global root G, and then you would grab
    the vector of lowest shard nodes called shard roots which you are tracking.
    you would finalize all of those which gives you a root hash for each of them
        that is what your vote would be...

But perhaps not every person who holds those shards votes right then...

I dont know how sharding voting should work...
Like you have to do tiered voting...
    So imagine you have a split node which is split in half
    and you watch half that sub tree...

Originally I thought the only reason not everyone votes on everything
    is because that would be a ton of noise on the network...
But what if you only share messages with people in the same shard-key-space.
    then the noise is localized until you get to the more global levels.


Each sub-shard produces an aggregate vote(signature)
Which is reported to the parent shard-spaces
    then select an evenly distributed subset of the total users in the parent space
    they derive the next parent spaces root hash, and the same thing happens recursively.


Perhaps voter selection happens from the top down though...
    And then in the lowest layers its open votings...
    but just in the higher layers there is some predefined set...


And the delay here shouldnt be that big of a deal...
I mean it will be slighly longer than ETH...
    but its just delayed finality... which shouldnt be that big of a deal.
