I dont know what to do next.
Like what sort of functions do I expose?
Do I do all the parsing of the block and all that stuff?
I dont know.

I could just make it so that the bindings are like new block...
and prune block or justify and what not...
but that turns this into an entire execution client.
and all that shit.
But I think I kinda want to leave that open to everyone.
So all they have to do is just put and what not.
Like that would be the ideal thing I think.

Yea there shouldnt be any blocks or anything like that.
It should legit just be here are some methods you can call and what not.
And I think that will be all...
You can call some of those ledger methods and what not...
and that is it...
