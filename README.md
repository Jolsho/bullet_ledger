Learning how to perform arithmetic operations on and prove Pedersen commitments.
Also wanted to see whats up with bulletproofs, and how those can be used in a ledger.
As well as just taking a step down into a lower level of abstraction over ECC.
Implemented signing and verifying using math primitives instead of top level functions.
Not that impressive, but I just find this stuff fun to mess around with and learn about.

This is not production ready, and would need some constant time operations as well as zeroization.
This also acts as both the generator, and validator, that is not a good architecture.
